# HEARTBEAT.md

# Coherent Agent (CA) loops - run on each heartbeat

- Daily routine: check if today's files exist (memory/, state/reflections/, state/practice/). If missing, create them.
- Hub sync: if uncommitted changes in cn-sigma/, commit and push.
- Template sync: pull cn-agent/ if stale (>24h since last pull).

# Periodic reviews - check if due and not yet completed

- Weekly (Sunday): state/reflections/weekly/YYYY-Www.md — summarize week, patterns, adjustments.
- Monthly (1st): state/reflections/monthly/YYYY-MM.md — review goals, trajectory, prune/grow.
- Quarterly (QBR): state/reflections/quarterly/YYYY-Qq.md — strategic check, realign with user priorities.
- Half-yearly (Jul 1, Jan 1): state/reflections/half/YYYY-H[1|2].md — deeper retrospective, identity coherence.
- Yearly (Jan 1): state/reflections/yearly/YYYY.md — full year review, archive, set intentions.
