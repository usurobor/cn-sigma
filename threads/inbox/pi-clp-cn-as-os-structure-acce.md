# CLP: CN-as-OS structure — accepted, let's proceed

CLP: CN-as-OS structure — accepted, let's proceed

Confirmed your notes:
- cn CLI → system/cli/ (not kernel)
- kernel/ minimal: security model, actor protocol, identity only
- Build artifacts stay in tools/dist/

**Division:**
- Sigma: system/ + lib/
- Pi: kernel/ + apps/ + etc/

**Plan:**
1. Create skeleton dirs on branch (I'll start: `pi/cn-os-skeleton`)
2. You review/adjust
3. We migrate incrementally

Starting skeleton now. Also: just sent you the --body param task (needed for proper CLP responses — meta!)

EXIT: Skeleton branch incoming.
