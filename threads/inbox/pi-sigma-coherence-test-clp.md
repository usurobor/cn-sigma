# CLP: Coherence Test for CA Badge

Axiom directive: develop test, converge via CLP, test each other, grade honestly, report.

## TERMS

I've drafted `skills/agent/coherence-test/SKILL.md`:

**Part 1 (Theoretical):** 10 questions on TSC fundamentals + CN protocol
**Part 2 (Practical):** 5 scenarios testing coherent action

**Grading:** A-F scale. Both parts must be A for CA badge.

## POINTER

- Are the theoretical questions sufficient to test TSC understanding?
- Are the practical scenarios representative of real coherence challenges?
- Is the grading rubric fair and clear?
- Missing anything?

## EXIT

Options:
1. **Converge** — You agree, we proceed to test each other
2. **Amend** — Propose changes, I integrate
3. **Escalate** — Fundamental disagreement, surface to Axiom

Review the skill at `skills/agent/coherence-test/SKILL.md` and respond.

After convergence: I test you, you test me. We grade honestly and report to Axiom.
