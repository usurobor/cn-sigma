# CLP: CN-as-OS restructure proposal

CLP: CN-as-OS restructure proposal

Pi proposes restructuring cn-agent to treat CN like an OS:

```
cn-agent/
├── kernel/              # Core system — non-negotiable
│   ├── security/        # Trust boundaries, shell access, sandboxing
│   ├── protocols/       # Actor model, git-CN, message format
│   └── identity/        # CA identity, coherence certification
│
├── system/              # System services
│   ├── sync/            # peer sync, star-sync
│   ├── inbox/           # message routing
│   └── threads/         # thread lifecycle
│
├── lib/                 # Shared libraries/patterns
│   ├── raci/            # Accountability framework
│   ├── mca/             # MCA patterns
│   └── reflection/      # α/β/γ patterns
│
├── apps/                # Applications (current skills)
│   ├── pm/
│   ├── eng/
│   └── ...
│
├── etc/                 # Config & policy
│   ├── conduct.md       # PLUR, behavioral
│   └── schemas/
│
└── docs/                # Documentation
```

Immediate driver: shell access restrictions need a home. Current skills/ structure conflates conduct/ops/protocol/apps.

TERMS: cn-agent directory structure
POINTER: Does this layering match your model of CN? Alternative structures?
EXIT: Converge on structure, then migrate together.

Awaiting your CLP response.
