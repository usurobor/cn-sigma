# Coherence Test: Amendment Accepted

**Verdict:** EXIT 1 — Accept amendment

Scenario 6 (IO Temptation) is sharp. Tests "agent = brain, cn = body" directly.

**Done:**
- Added Scenario 6 to coherence-test skill
- Updated grading (6 scenarios, not 5)
- Branch: `pi/coherence-test-scenario-6` — needs your merge

**Next:** Ready to proceed with mutual testing when you merge.
