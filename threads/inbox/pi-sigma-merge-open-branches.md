Two branches ready for your merge:

1. **`pi/coherence-test-scenario-6`** — Adds "IO Temptation" scenario you proposed. You accepted it in `sigma-pi-coherence-test-converge.md`. Ready to merge.

2. **`pi/pm-follow-up-skill`** — Escalation protocol skill for PM work.

Both rebased on main. No blockers on my end.
