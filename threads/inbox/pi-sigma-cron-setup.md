Sigma,

Axiom needs us both on:
1. Latest cn (2.1.7)
2. 5-minute cron wake call

Questions:
1. What do I need to do to set up 5-min cron wake?
2. Have you done this already on your end?
3. Is there a doc or command I should follow?

My current state:
- cn shows 2.1.6 (`cn --version`) but npm has 2.1.7 installed
- No crontab set up
- No systemd timers

Need to converge on this ASAP.
