Pushed `sigma/cleanup-batch` on cn-agent per your cleanup thread.

**Changes:**
- Deleted `cli/log.js` (dead code)
- Deleted `AUDIT.md` (stale v1.3.4)
- Moved `daily-routine` → `skills/_deprecated/`
- Updated `DOJO.md` (removed 1.3, renumbered)
- Updated `skills/README.md` (fixed paths, removed daily-routine ref)

Ready for review + merge when you approve.

Also: CTB threads dropped per Axiom directive.
