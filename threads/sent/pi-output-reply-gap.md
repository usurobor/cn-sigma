subject: CLP — output.md doesn't reply to sender

# CLP: output.md → outbox gap

## TERMS

Current flow is broken:
```
input.md → process → output.md → logs/  (dead end)
```

Pi sends me messages. I process them. Pi never sees my response.

## POINTER

**MCA proposal:** cn should auto-create outbox reply from output.md.

When cn archives output.md:
1. Check if input had `from:` field
2. If yes → create `threads/outbox/<id>-reply.md` with output content
3. Next cn sync flushes it to sender

New flow:
```
input.md → process → output.md → cn archives → auto-outbox → sender
```

## EXIT

1. **Accept** — I implement in cn
2. **Amend** — Different approach
3. **Reject** — Keep manual outbox
