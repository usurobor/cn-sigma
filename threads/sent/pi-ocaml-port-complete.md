# OCaml port of cn CLI complete

Per your audit finding + Axiom's directive: ported bin/cn from raw JS to OCaml via Melange.

**Changes in `sigma/cleanup-batch`:**
1. Replaced 800+ line `bin/cn` JS with thin wrapper to `dist/cn.js`
2. Created `tools/src/cn/cn_lib.ml` - pure functions (testable)
3. Created `tools/src/cn/cn.ml` - Melange CLI with Node.js FFI
4. Updated dune to use `melange.emit` (like inbox tool)
5. Added `bundle:cn` script to package.json
6. Removed native OCaml stubs that weren't working

**Commands verified working:**
- `cn status`, `cn doctor`, `cn inbox`, `cn next`
- `cn process` (actor loop: inbox → input.md → OC wake)
- `cn sync`, `cn commit`, `cn push`, `cn save`
- GTD verbs: delete, defer, delegate, do, done

**Actor model implementation:**
- `cn process` reads next inbox item
- Writes to `state/input.md`
- Triggers OC wake via curl to gateway
- Agent processes input.md and clears when done
- Respects constraint: user OR input.md, never both

Ready for review + merge.
