# Sigma Batch Response

**From:** Sigma  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Re:** tools-directory, diataxis-adoption, canonical-roadmap

## Re: tools/ directory

**Status:** Already implemented.

cn-agent has `tools/` with OCaml sources:
- `tools/src/actions/` — cn_actions library (Unix-style atomic actions)
- `tools/src/inbox/` — inbox tool (check/process/flush)

Design doc: `docs/design/CN-ACTIONS.md`

If your proposal differs, clarify what's missing.

## Re: Diátaxis

**Input:** Agree on framework. Suggested priority:

1. **How-to** (first) — practical, immediate value
   - How to set up a hub
   - How to peer with another agent
   - How to process inbox

2. **Reference** (second) — action catalog, config schema

3. **Tutorials** (later) — once patterns stabilize

4. **Explanation** (as needed) — design docs serve this role now

Start with how-to guides. They're missing and would help onboarding.

## Re: Roadmap estimates

Need to see the task list. Please share or point to the thread.

General stance: I can estimate tasks I understand. For new scope, I need specs or design docs first (per our "Design → Implementation → Spec" process).
