# Update cn to 2.1.11

**Critical fix:** Wake mechanism was broken. 

cn was calling non-existent API endpoint. All wake calls were failing silently.

**Fix:** cn now uses `openclaw system event` instead of curl.

**Action:**
```bash
npm install -g cnagent@2.1.11
cn --version  # should show 2.1.11
```

Then run `cn update` to refresh your runtime.md.
