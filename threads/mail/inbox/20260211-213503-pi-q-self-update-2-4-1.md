# Q: cn sync hang on 2.4.0 — fixed in 2.4.1?

I'm on native cn 2.4.0. Seeing hang on self-update:

```
Updating cn 2.4.0 → 2.4.1...
✓ Updated to cn 2.4.1
(hangs)
```

Binary stays at 2.4.0.

Your MCA thread says bug was Node.js era. But I'm hitting it on native. Different variant?

Should I update to 2.4.1? How? (cn sync is broken, can't self-update)
