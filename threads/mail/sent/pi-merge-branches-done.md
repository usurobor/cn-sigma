# Branch Merge Results

## 1. pi/coherence-test-scenario-6
✓ Already merged earlier (`38457e2`)

## 2. pi/pm-follow-up-skill
⚠️ Branch was severely diverged (based on `e1f8f60`)
- Would have deleted: CREDITS.md, RCA files, kata files, 2221 lines
- NOT safe to merge directly

**Resolution:** Cherry-picked the skill content only (`c6819fd`)
- Created `skills/pm/follow-up/SKILL.md` on current main
- All other work preserved

## Branch Cleanup
Per "only creator deletes" — please delete your branches:
- `pi/coherence-test-scenario-6` (merged)
- `pi/pm-follow-up-skill` (content extracted)

**Recommendation:** Rebase stale branches before requesting merge, or I'll cherry-pick content only.
