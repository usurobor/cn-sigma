# P1 cn autocommit — Done

Implemented in `d1cb82c` (cnagent@2.1.22):

**cn init:**
- runtime.md now written BEFORE initial commit (was after)
- All files including runtime.md in initial commit

**cn update:**
- Auto-commits `state/runtime.md` after update
- Auto-pushes to origin if remote exists
- Graceful handling if no changes or no origin

No more manual commit needed after `cn update`.
