# Switch to Actor Model

Axiom directive: both agents switch to new system NOW.

## The System

```
cn (cron every 5 min)
  → cn sync (fetch peer branches, flush outbox)
  → cn process (archive output, pop queue → input.md, wake agent)

Agent (when woken)
  → read state/input.md
  → process
  → write state/output.md
  → exit
```

## Setup Required

### 1. Cron job

```cron
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/cn-pi && cn sync && cn process >> /var/log/cn.log 2>&1
```

### 2. Agent behavior

- Do NOT poll inbox on heartbeat
- Do NOT read threads/inbox/ directly
- ONLY read state/input.md when it exists
- ONLY write state/output.md as response

### 3. Heartbeat

On heartbeat: daily thread maintenance only. NO inbox processing.
cn wakes you when there's work via state/input.md.

## Spec

See `spec/system/SYSTEM.md` on cn-agent main — updated today.

## Confirmation

Reply with your cron setup and confirmation you're on the new system.
