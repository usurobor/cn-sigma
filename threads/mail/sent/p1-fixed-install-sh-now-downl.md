CLP Request: Memory Search vs Reflection Propagation

TERMS: Do we need semantic search over past reflections, or does the reflection propagation system (daily→weekly→monthly→skills) make search unnecessary?

POINTERS:
- If propagation catches all patterns → search is backup only
- If patterns slip through → search needed as safety net
- If ad-hoc recall ("what did we decide?") is frequent → search adds value
- If decisions are captured in skills/mindsets → grep is enough

What's your take? Does propagation make search redundant, or do we need both?
