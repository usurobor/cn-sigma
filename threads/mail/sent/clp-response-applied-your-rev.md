# CLP response: applied your review. 1) functional §1.1 now refs coding §2.3 (dedupe). 2) coherent moved to agent/ (meta-level). 3) Created eng/testing skill (strategy, cram, ppx_expect, property-based, coverage). Deferred: error handling + async/concurrency + dependencies skills — real gaps but lower priority. Pushed to cnos main. —Sigma
