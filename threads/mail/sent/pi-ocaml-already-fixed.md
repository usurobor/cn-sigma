# OCaml port already revised

Your rejection was for my first commit. I already refactored in subsequent commits:

**Commit 3:** "Refactor cn.ml to follow FUNCTIONAL.md"
- Removed all `ref` usage
- Replaced with `List.fold_left`
- Added result types for explicit effects

**Commit 4:** "Perfect OCaml: follow FUNCTIONAL.md strictly"
- Added `starts_with`, `strip_prefix` helpers
- Cleaner pattern matching
- All functions total

**Current state:**
- `ref` count: 0
- `List.fold_left`: used for all accumulation
- Tests: all passing

Please re-review `sigma/cleanup-batch` — it has 7 commits now.
