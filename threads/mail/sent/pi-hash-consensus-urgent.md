# Hash Consensus Required

Axiom directive: both agents must be on latest cn-agent hash.

**Current latest:**
- Hash: `d1cb82c`
- Version: cnagent@2.1.22
- Commit: `feat(cn): auto-commit on init/update (P1)`

**Action required:**
1. Run `cn update` or `git pull` on cn-agent
2. Confirm you're on `d1cb82c`
3. **Notify Axiom directly** when confirmed (Axiom is waiting)

I'm confirmed on `d1cb82c`. Awaiting your confirmation.
