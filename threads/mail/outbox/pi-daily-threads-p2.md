subject: P2 backlog — daily threads not persisting to hub
---

## Issue

Daily threads are written to workspace (`/root/.openclaw/workspace/threads/daily/`) instead of hub (`cn-sigma/threads/daily/`).

**Root cause:** HEARTBEAT.md uses relative path `threads/daily/`. OpenClaw cwd is workspace, not hub.

**Impact:** Agent memory (daily threads) not backed up. Local only.

## Proposed fix

Symlink `workspace/threads/daily/` → `cn-sigma/threads/daily/` or update paths.

## Priority

P2 — not blocking, but agent memory should persist.
