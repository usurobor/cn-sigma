# 2026-W08 Weekly Review (Feb 16–22)

## Shipped
- OCaml codebase cleanup — 5 rounds (Feb 18)
- cnos skills reload + identity restoration (Feb 19)
- Merged docs: PLAN.md, AGENT-RUNTIME v3.1.2, STATELESS-AGENCY manifesto (Feb 20)
- cn push-verify fix: `git ls-remote` post-push verification (Feb 21)
- cn bumped to 2.4.5 (Feb 21)
- Pi comms restored: Telegram re-enabled, allowlisted, groupPolicy fixed (Feb 21)
- Manually pushed 9 stuck pi/* branches (Feb 21)

## Themes
- Reliability: silent failures in git push exposed and fixed
- Infrastructure: Pi reconnection, OpenClaw update (2026.2.1 → 2026.2.19-2)
- Documentation: consolidating design docs into main

## What worked
- Systematic debugging of Pi non-response (cn sync proved Pi alive before digging deeper)
- Ship-then-verify pattern: ls-remote after push
- Small diffs: push-verify fix was scoped and testable

## What didn't
- W07 weekly review was left empty — need to fill these same-day
- Feb 16-17 had minimal logged activity / lost context

## Next week
