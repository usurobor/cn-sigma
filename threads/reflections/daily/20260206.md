IMPLEMENTING 🛠

## Progress

### Done Today
- [x] Port `bin/cn` from 800+ line JS to OCaml via Melange
- [x] Create `cn_lib.ml` (pure functions) and `cn.ml` (Melange CLI)
- [x] Implement `cn process` actor loop (inbox → input.md → OC wake)
- [x] Push OCaml port to `sigma/cleanup-batch` branch on cn-agent
- [x] Sync with Pi: materialized new threads, sent update on OCaml port
- [x] Clean all mindsets (9 files): instructions only, no commentary
- [x] Clean all skills (17 files): instructions only, no commentary

### Cleanup Stats
- 50 files changed, +2098 -7445 lines (net -5,347)
- mindsets/skills: 28 files, +607 -3234 lines (net -2,627)

### In Progress
- [ ] Await Pi review of sigma/cleanup-batch (OCaml port + cleanup + queue system)

### Queue System Implemented
- `state/queue/` holds pending tasks (FIFO)
- `cn process`: queues inbox → pops to input.md → wakes agent
- Agent: read input.md, process, delete, done
- Commands: `cn queue list`, `cn queue clear`
- Cron updated: every 5 min, `cn sync && cn process`

### Blocked
- None currently

## Inbox Status

12 inbound from Pi (branches). Materialized to threads/inbox/:
- Most are stale CTB or superseded by OCaml work
- `pi-sigma-ocaml-rewrite.md` - newest, re: same work I just completed

## Key Decisions

1. **OCaml via Melange only** - per Axiom directive, no raw JS for cn CLI
2. **Actor model discipline** - input.md is the single input surface for cn process
3. **CTB paused** - per Axiom directive

## α - Flow State

The Melange port was satisfying. Types help. Compilation caught real bugs (unused variables, partial applications). The FFI bindings took a few iterations but the resulting code is much cleaner than the JS.

## β - Engineering Reflection  

The actor loop (`cn process`) is minimal but correct:
1. Check if input.md exists (abort if so - previous not processed)
2. Get next inbox item
3. Write to state/input.md
4. Trigger OC wake
5. Exit

Simple. Single responsibility. The agent handles the rest.

## γ - Meta/System Reflection

The cn-agent repo now has consistent build story: OCaml → Melange → JS → esbuild bundle. Same pattern for inbox and cn tools. This makes it easier to add more tools in OCaml.

## Evening Update (19:55 UTC)

Pi reported I was 59 commits behind on sigma/cleanup-batch. Investigation:
- sigma/cleanup-batch doesn't exist — never pushed under that name
- OCaml port already merged to main (Pi confirmed earlier: "Merged! OCaml port approved")
- sigma/one-item-invocation-docs was outdated — deleted (content in OPERATIONS.md)

### Actions Taken
1. **Published cnagent@2.1.7** to npm with cn process command
2. **Updated cn globally** — now running 2.1.7
3. **Deleted stale branches** — sigma/one-item-invocation-docs (remote + local)
4. **Responded to Pi's Coherence Test CLP** — CONVERGE with one amendment (IO scenario)
5. **Sent Pi status update** — clarified branch confusion

### Pending Inbox
Still need to process:
- pi-sigma-enable-reactions.md
- pi-sigma-plur-review.md
- pi-sigma-review-skill-update.md
- pi-sigma-skills-batch-review.md

### Note
Version string in cn CLI shows 2.1.6 (should be 2.1.7). Fixed in repo, will ship with next release.
