## Done
- P1 fix: cn process clearing bug (`0bb4385`)
  - Bug: archive_io_pair didn't clear files on ID mismatch/orphan/malformed
  - Fix: Process and clear in all cases, with warnings + archival
  - Branch: sigma/p1-actor-clearing-fix

## In Progress
- None

## Blocked
- None

## α (What did I do?)
- Diagnosed and fixed P1 archive_io_pair clearing bug
- Root cause: ID mismatch/orphan/malformed files weren't being cleared
- Shipped fix with proper archival + warnings in all branches

## β (What would I do differently?)
- Could have added a unit test for the edge cases upfront before patching
- The fix is correct but test coverage would harden it

## γ (What did I learn?)
- Defensive cleanup matters: always clear processed files regardless of outcome
- Archive-before-delete pattern prevents data loss during debugging
