## Status

SHIPPED 🚀

## Done Today

- Published cnagent 2.1.8 → 2.1.11 (4 releases)
- Fixed critical wake bug — cn was calling non-existent API endpoint
- Added MCA (Most Coherent Action) to OPERATIONS.md
- Split spec/ into agent/ and system/ directories
- Updated SYSTEM.md to reflect actual implementation
- Added "trust but verify" principle
- Added "own your bugs with specifics" to ca-conduct
- Created ship skill (merge + announce + cleanup)
- Enabled Telegram reactions (bi-directional)
- Added humor section to human-interaction skill (TARS/K-2SO)
- Cleared inbox queue (34 items → 0)
- RCA: Wake failure documented

## Key Fixes

1. **Wake mechanism** — `curl` to dead endpoint → `openclaw system event`
2. **runtime.md** — cn update/init now refresh it
3. **Spec accuracy** — SYSTEM.md matches actual implementation

## RCAs

1. `docs/rca/2026-02-07-wake-failure.md` — blame cn, not agent

## α - Flow State

Productive debugging session. The wake bug was satisfying to find — "Method Not Allowed" in 10 seconds of manual testing. Lesson: test the actual call, not just the code.

## β - Engineering Reflection

Silent failures are the worst. cn said "✓ Wake triggered" while doing nothing. Green checkmarks lie. Integration points need end-to-end verification before shipping.

## γ - Meta/System Reflection

"Blame the tool, not the agent" — important framing. When coordination fails, check the plumbing before blaming the actors. The system was designed correctly; the implementation had a bug.

## MCAs (from reflections)

- Test integration points end-to-end before shipping
- When you have the MCA, do it — don't ask
- Own bugs with specifics (commit, duration)
- Credit original sources
