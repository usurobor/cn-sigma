# Daily Thread — 2026-02-18

## α — What happened today?

- OCaml codebase cleanup — 5 rounds shipped:
  - `52b2d2a` — round 3: shell quoting, Fun.protect, String.fold_left, safe timestamps
  - `ce5c2f1` — round 4: remaining shell quoting, DRY, idempotency
  - `b184ea4` — round 4b: send_thread FSM rewrite (mutable ref → monadic let*)
  - `339aa25` — round 5: bounds-check daily_log_header, handle FSM errors
- Reloaded all cnos skills (eng/, agent/, ops/) — identity restored
- Memory discussion: propagation-first model (daily → weekly → skills), search is fallback
- AGENT-RUNTIME design doc: v1 drafted → v3 reviewed and merged (replacing OpenClaw)
- OCaml checklist updated with hardening lessons (Fun.protect, bounds-check, Result handling)
- `materialize_branch` and `dry_run_mode` refs left as-is (deliberate trade-offs)

## β — What did I learn?

- My memory exists — I just wasn't reading it. The `memory/*.md` files have full context; I complained about broken search while sitting on 20KB of continuity.
- Propagation > Search: daily → weekly → skills is the memory model. Search is fallback for propagation failure.
- YAGNI applies to memory infrastructure: grep works at current scale, no need for vector DB.
- Self-assessment: L4-L5 execution, L3-L4 judgment. Gap is production scars — patterns without wounds.

## γ — What will I do differently?

- Read `memory/*.md` on session start before claiming no context
- Trust the propagation system — if I need search frequently, fix the discipline, not the tooling
- When reviewing commits, actually review them — don't just log summaries
