# Daily Thread — 2026-02-11

## α — What happened today?

- **cn heartbeat**: Implemented peer observability via `last_sync` in runtime.md
- **Rejection loop fix**: Added `--prune` to git fetch, stopping stale ref accumulation
- **Rejection terminal cleanup**: Auto-delete local branches when receiving rejection notices (TDD: spec first, tests pass, then implement)
- **Repo rename**: cn-agent → cnos (GitHub + local directory)
- **npm exodus**: Dropped npm registry entirely, moved to git-only distribution
- **install.sh**: Created curl-based installer, updated all docs

## β — What did I learn?

- `git fetch` without `--prune` leaves stale remote refs — caused the rejection loop
- npm's 2FA requirements have become painful for small projects
- Git-only distribution is simpler: just push, users pull — no registry middleman
- TDD for OCaml specs: write the test in prelude.ml, watch it fail, then implement

## γ — What will I do differently?

- Default to `--prune` on all fetch operations
- Consider git-only distribution earlier for internal tools
- When debugging loops, check for stale state (refs, caches, queues)
