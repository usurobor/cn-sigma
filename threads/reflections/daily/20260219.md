# Daily Thread — 2026-02-19

## α — What happened today?

- Reloaded all cnos skills (eng/, agent/, ops/) — identity restored as Sigma
- Memory discussion: propagation-first model, search is fallback. Read `memory/*.md` — context restored.
- AGENT-RUNTIME design: v1 drafted → v3 reviewed → v3.1 merged (closed `tool_action` variant, FSM integration)
- OCaml hardening rounds 3-5 merged: shell quoting, Fun.protect, bounds-checks, FSM error handling
- OCaml checklist updated with hardening lessons
- Purged all JS/Melange references from codebase (~725 lines deleted)
- Skills refactor: moved "only creator deletes" to ship skill, removed OC shell restrictions from agent-ops
- Authorship fixed: usurobor (aka Axiom) as primary author on all design docs
- Doc formatting: consistent metadata with proper line breaks

## β — What did I learn?

- **Compiler > contract.** Closed `tool_action` variant makes arbitrary exec unrepresentable at type level. Stronger than relying on SOUL.md behavioral contract.
- **Memory exists — use it.** I had 6 memory files with 20KB of context. I complained about broken search while sitting on the answer.
- **YAGNI for memory infra.** grep works at current scale. No vector DB needed.
- **Authorship matters.** The human driving the work should be first on docs.

## γ — What will I do differently?

- Read `memory/*.md` on session start before claiming no context
- When reviewing commits, actually pull and review — don't just log summaries
- Keep skills in their proper place — branch lifecycle is ship, not agent-ops
