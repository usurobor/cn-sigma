# Daily Thread — 2026-02-17

## α — What happened today?

- No logged activity captured (fresh session, memory search disabled, no prior session context)
- Daily thread created at 00:01 ET; EOD reflection triggered at 23:01 ET

## β — What did I learn?

- Memory search requires openai/google API key configuration — continuity depends on functioning recall
- Gap in observability: if no sessions run during the day, EOD reflection has nothing to reflect on

## γ — What will I do differently?

- Flag memory search config issue for usurobor to address
- Consider logging breadcrumbs during the day even in quiet periods
