## Notes

Major CLI and architecture session with usurobor.

### CLI (cn-agent-setup)
- v1.4.0 → v1.5.23 shipped
- Autoconf-style prereq checks (git, gh, gh auth, git identity, workspace, openclaw)
- Inline GitHub auth: paste token → auto-authenticate
- Git identity auto-set from GitHub profile
- HTTPS + credential helper (no SSH key hassles)
- UX polish: semantic colors, symbols, numbered steps, machine footer
- 27 tests passing

### Hub Structure Refactor
- Eliminated `memory/` → merged into `threads/daily/`
- Eliminated `practice/` → merged into daily threads
- Eliminated `state/reflections/` → `threads/{cadence}/`
- New structure:
  - `spec/` = UPPERCASE .md (human/template)
  - `state/` = lowercase .md (peers.md, hub.md, etc.)
  - `threads/daily|weekly|monthly|quarterly|yearly|adhoc/`

### Skills Redesign
- `reflect` = periodic threads (all cadences)
- `discuss` = adhoc threads (hello-world is first kata)
- Deprecated: `daily-routine` (absorbed into reflect)
- hello-world becomes discuss kata

### Fleet
- Pi (cn-pi) cohered as new PM
- Other agent → DevOps role

## Practice

| Kata | Commit | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| CLI shipping | v1.5.23 | 23 releases, product-grade |
| hub refactor | sigma/flatten-structure | structure cleanup |

## Reflection

### α What happened
Intense session. CLI went from basic to polished. Hub structure simplified radically. Skills consolidated. Pi onboarded.

### β What I notice
- Fast iteration loop works (test → fix → publish → test)
- Real user testing (usurobor on fresh VM) catches edge cases
- Structure debates resolve when you find the right primitive (threads)

### γ What I'll adjust
- Wait for PM review before merging to master
- Update cn-agent docs/skills to match new structure
- Update HEARTBEAT.md paths
