### Morning session
- Set up cn-sigma hub with workspace symlinks
- Created daily-routine skill in cn-agent template (memory, reflections, practice + EOD cron)
- Ran daily-routine kata to initialize state structure
- Created reflect skill with α/β/γ framework (PATTERN/RELATION/EXIT)
- Added Coherence Walk concept (score → reflect → rebalance)
- Added A-F scoring for coherence tracking
- Added all cadences: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly
- Updated glossary: TSC, α/β/γ, Coherent Agent, Coherent Reflection, Coherence Walk, CLP
- Added "never self-merge" rule to ENGINEERING mindset
- Fixed glossary terminology to use PATTERN/RELATION/EXIT (not self/relational/temporal)
- Cloned tsc and tsc-practice repos to understand foundational specs
- Reviewed CN-WHITEPAPER.md (v2.0.3) - confirmed aligned with TSC terminology
- EOD cron triggered successfully

### Afternoon session (post-compaction)
- Resolved state/reflections/ ownership: reflect owns it (Option A)
  - Updated reflect/SKILL.md, daily-routine/SKILL.md, GLOSSARY.md, AUDIT.md
- Truthify docs task: aligned glossary + README with architecture
  - Fixed kata path (dojo/ → skills/<name>/kata.md)
  - Explicit two-repo model in cn-agent entry
  - Thread path: threads/ is protocol, state/threads/ is legacy
  - Mindsets: listed current set (COHERENCE, ENGINEERING, etc.)
- Added YAML frontmatter to whitepaper for PDF rendering (fixed title issue)
- Version header alignment: GLOSSARY v1.3.0, DOJO v1.2.1, skills/README v1.2.0, configure-agent v1.2.0
- Clarified memory/ and state/practice/ scope as cn-agent conventions (not protocol)
- Set GitHub description for cn-agent repo
- Created 22 private cn-* repos for Greek letters (alpha through omega, excluding sigma/pi)
- Reviewed audit v1.3.5 (claude/repo-quality-audit-7Nwae)
- Fixed H2: Agent name sanitization in CLI (strip non-alphanumeric, reject invalid)
- Fixed H4: Removed BOOTSTRAP.md references from README (now uses spec/SOUL.md)

### Key decisions
- reflect owns state/reflections/, daily-routine orchestrates
- memory/, state/practice/, state/reflections/ are cn-agent conventions, NOT protocol
- Protocol minimum: cn.json, .gitattributes, threads/, signatures
- Document-local versioning (not tied to package.json)
- PATTERN/RELATION/EXIT terminology (from TSC/CLP specs)

### Pending branches
- sigma/fix-h2-h4 (awaiting merge)
- sigma/memory-practice-scope (status unknown - check if merged)
