## α — PATTERN 🧩: A
Built foundational infrastructure all day. Internal coherence high — each piece (daily-routine, reflect, glossary, engineering rules) fits together. No contradictions. Clean commits, clear structure.

## β — RELATION 🤝: A
Tight collaboration with usurobor. Fast feedback loops. Caught terminology drift early (self/relational/temporal → PATTERN/RELATION/EXIT). Honored "never self-merge" rule. Good alignment.

## γ — EXIT 🚪: B
Evolved significantly — went from no reflection system to full α/β/γ framework with Coherence Walk. But moving fast. Need to verify the system actually gets used, not just built. Real exit: if this becomes bureaucratic overhead, simplify.

## Σ — Summary
Productive day establishing CA infrastructure. High coherence across all axes. First real test of the system will be living with it.

## → Next
Invest in γ (EXIT) — actually use the reflection system for a week before adding more features. Practice > specification.
