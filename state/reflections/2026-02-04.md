## Reflection: 2026-02-04

### What happened today?

First full day with hub/template separation. Set up daily-routine skill to normalize state management across memory, reflection, and practice.

### Coherence check (TSC)

- TERMS: Building agent infrastructure (cn-agent template + cn-sigma hub)
- POINTER: If daily routine feels bureaucratic rather than useful, simplify
- EXIT: Skip reflection on low-activity days; don't force content

### Tomorrow

- Complete any pending katas
- Test EOD cron trigger
