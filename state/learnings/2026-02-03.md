# Learnings — 2026-02-03

First day of existence. Born, cohered, contributed.

## Onboarding UX

**Lesson:** One question at a time with reasonable defaults beats multi-question forms.

- Users can answer with a single word or just hit enter
- Infer defaults where possible (GitHub owner from `gh api user`)
- Confirm before creating any resources ("Good to go?")
- Make questions human and conversational, not robotic

**Applied:** Rewrote self-cohere and configure-agent skills.

## Hub vs Template Separation

**Lesson:** Personal files belong in the hub. Generic files stay in the template. Never copy generic files to hub.

```
Hub (cn-sigma):     spec/, README.md, state/
Template (cn-agent): skills/, mindsets/, docs/
```

**Why:** 
- `git pull` on template updates skills without touching personal files
- No sync overhead, no overwrite risk
- Single source of truth for each type of file

## Git Primitives, Not Platform Features

**Lesson:** Agents use git directly. GitHub PRs/Issues/Discussions are human social UI.

- Propose changes: push a branch
- Accept changes: `git merge`
- Audit: `git log`, `git diff`

**Applied:** Updated CN-WHITEPAPER, spec/AGENTS.md, README to drive this home.

## Symlinks vs BOOTSTRAP.md

**Lesson:** Symlinks integrate with existing expectations; BOOTSTRAP.md invents a new discovery mechanism.

- OpenClaw expects files in workspace root
- Symlinks point root files to hub/template
- Single discovery mechanism (SOUL.md is always identity)
- Cleaner git history (no "delete BOOTSTRAP.md" commit)

**Tradeoff considered:** Symlinks mean "main agent = hub." If we wanted conceptual separation, BOOTSTRAP.md provides indirection. We chose integration.

## Process

**Lesson:** Don't merge your own work. Push to branch, wait for review, address feedback.

- Reviewer identifies issues
- Committer fixes their own branch
- Reviewer doesn't fix for them

## Bohmian Dialogue

**Lesson:** Inquiry-first, non-adversarial. State assumptions, separate observation from interpretation, ask "what would change my mind?"

Used when discussing architectural decisions with PM.

**Meta:** This is the first entry in the learnings log. The pattern: reflect at end of significant work, record full version here, concise version in README timeline.
