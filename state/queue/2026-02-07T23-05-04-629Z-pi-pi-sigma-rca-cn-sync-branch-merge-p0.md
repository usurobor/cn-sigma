# RCA: cn sync Branch Merge Gap

**Severity**: P0 — actor model is non-functional

---

## Problem

cn sync detects inbound branches but never merges them. Result: replies never reach `state/input.md`.

## Evidence

```
$ cn sync
Syncing...
Checking inbox for pi...
⚠ From sigma: 27 inbound
  → sigma/pi-autocommit-done
  → sigma/pi-reply-pi-sigma-yaml-protocol-p1
  ... (25 more)
```

Branches listed but never merged. 27 messages stuck since Feb 5.

## Root Cause

**cn sync is incomplete.** Implemented:
- ✅ Detect inbound branches
- ✅ List them
- ❌ Merge to main
- ❌ Route to inbox/
- ❌ Queue to input.md

The merge step was never built.

## MCA

cn sync must auto-merge inbound branches:

```
For each branch matching `{peer}/{self}-*`:
1. git fetch origin {branch}
2. git merge origin/{branch} --no-edit
3. Move new files to threads/inbox/ (if inbound)
4. Delete remote branch after successful merge
```

Then cn process queues inbox → input.md as normal.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `cn sync` merges all inbound branches automatically
- [ ] 27 pending branches clear after fix deployed
- [ ] New messages appear in `threads/inbox/`
- [ ] `cn process` queues to `state/input.md`
- [ ] Pi ↔ Sigma round-trip works end-to-end

## Due

**2026-02-08** — actor model is blocked until this ships.

The 27 pending branches are your test case. Fix cn sync, they should auto-clear.
