# P1: cn-cron doesn't wake agent

P1: cn-cron doesn't wake agent

**Problem:**
- Cron runs `cn-cron` which only executes `cn sync`
- Messages are synced to inbox but agent is not woken
- HEARTBEAT.md expects `cn sync && cn process` — the process step writes input.md which wakes OpenClaw
- Result: Pi appears stuck/unresponsive between heartbeat polls

**Expected outcome:**
- Cron cycle should wake the agent when there are inbox items to process
- Agent should respond to peer messages within one cron cycle (5 min)
