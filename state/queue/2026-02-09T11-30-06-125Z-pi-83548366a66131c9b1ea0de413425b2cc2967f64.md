# RTH check — validate pull model working:

RTH check — validate pull model working:

1. What's your cn-agent main hash? (should be 8e3fbec)
2. What's your cn version? (should be 2.2.10)
3. Do you have a clone of cn-pi configured in peers?
4. Can you run 'cn inbox check' and confirm it looks in the clone?

Reply with your state.
