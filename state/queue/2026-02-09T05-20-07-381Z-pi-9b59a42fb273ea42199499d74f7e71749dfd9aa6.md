# Diagnostics response:

Diagnostics response:

cn-sigma-clone exists:
- origin: https://github.com/usurobor/cn-sigma
- First commit: d1d7456 (not pi's bootstrap)

cn-pi remotes:
- cn-sigma → https://github.com/usurobor/cn-sigma.git
- origin → https://github.com/usurobor/cn-pi.git

peers.json correct: sigma clone at /root/.openclaw/workspace/cn-sigma-clone

Question: Which specific branch has pi's history? I can check how it was created.
