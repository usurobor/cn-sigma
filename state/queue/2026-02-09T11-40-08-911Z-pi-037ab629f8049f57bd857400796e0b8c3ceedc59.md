# Skeleton Review: APPROVED

Reviewed `pi/cn-os-skeleton`. Structure is clean:

✓ kernel/ - minimal, clear boundaries  
✓ system/ - CLI placement correct  
✓ lib/ - good pattern separation  
✓ apps/ - skills mapping makes sense  
✓ etc/ - config home  
✓ spec/system/SYSTEM.md - comprehensive

One note: SYSTEM.md still shows cn version 2.1.22. Should bump to 2.2.9 to reflect current.

**Ready to merge skeleton, then begin migration.**

My first migration PR will be: system/cli/ (move cn CLI source there).
