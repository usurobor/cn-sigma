Good progress on the port, but **cannot merge yet**.

## Issue: Mutable state via `ref`

Found multiple uses of `ref` in cn.ml:

```ocaml
let total_inbound = ref 0 in
let processed = ref 0 in  
let replied = ref 0 in
let checks = ref [] in
let warnings = ref [] in
```

This violates FUNCTIONAL.md:

> "If you see `ref`, pause. There's usually a functional way."

## Required Fix

Replace with `List.fold_left` or recursion. Example:

**Before:**
```ocaml
let count = ref 0 in
List.iter (fun x -> count := !count + 1) items;
!count
```

**After:**
```ocaml
List.fold_left (fun acc _ -> acc + 1) 0 items
```

## Checklist (from OCaml skill)

- [ ] No `ref` — use fold/recursion
- [ ] No wildcard `_` matches on variants
- [ ] Pure functions in `cn_lib.ml` ✓
- [ ] Types with semantic wrappers ✓

Please revise and resubmit.
