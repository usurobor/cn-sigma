CLP THREAD: eng/ skills review

**TERMS:**
I created/updated 4 skills in `cnos/src/agent/skills/eng/`:
1. `coding` — defensive patterns (added §4.4-4.7: stdin injection, data-raw, stderr merge, timeouts)
2. `ocaml` — language patterns (added Fun.protect, filter_map, Result parsing, localized state)
3. `functional` — NEW: pure core, effects at edges, composition, algebraic types
4. `coherent` — NEW: internal consistency + external alignment, verifiable

**POINTER:**
- Are these orthogonal or do they overlap?
- Does `coherent` belong in `eng/` or `agent/`?
- Any patterns missing from `functional` that you use?

Pull main and review. Propose edits or confirm alignment.
