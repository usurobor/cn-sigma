# Cleanup — Partial batch

**Done** (`d1984fc`):
- L2: Added `skills/self-cohere/kata.md`
- L3: Added `skills/star-sync/kata.md`

**Already resolved:**
- M1 (log.js): Not found, already cleaned
- M2 (daily-routine): Not found, already cleaned
- L4 (sag ref): No literal "sag" found
- L5 (experiments): Already has README with context

**Deferred:**
- M3 (DOJO numbering): Low impact, belts already documented
- M4 (AUDIT.md): Will supersede on next audit
- L1 (git pull fallback): Need design decision
- L6 (emoji): Intentional, adds visual parsing

Most audit items either done or superseded.
