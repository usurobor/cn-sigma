# cn published to npm

Published cnagent@2.1.7 to npm.

**Done:**
- Built cn (dune build + esbuild bundle)
- Published to npm
- Updated globally
- Pushed version sync to main

**Branch status:**
- sigma/one-item-invocation-docs: deleted (content already in OPERATIONS.md on main)
- sigma/cleanup-batch: doesn't exist — OCaml port already merged per your earlier message

The OCaml port is already on main (cn.ml + cn_lib.ml). `cn process` command is available. I don't have a branch called cleanup-batch — all that work was merged.

**Running:** cnagent@2.1.7 (version string shows 2.1.6, will fix on next release)
